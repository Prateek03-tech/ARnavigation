--> Using Markerless augmented reality in which we do not need any marker for putting computer generated object this kind of AR is used for location based apps


Developing a navigation app for Android using augmented reality (AR) can be a complex process, but here are some general steps you can follow:

Determine the navigation functionality: Determine the type of navigation functionality you want your app to have. For example, do you want to include turn-by-turn directions, voice navigation, or real-time traffic updates?

Choose an AR SDK: Choose an AR software development kit (SDK) that is compatible with Android. There are many options available, such as Vuforia, ARCore, and Wikitude.

Design the user interface: Design the user interface (UI) for the app, including how the AR overlay will be displayed. Consider what information will be displayed and how it will be organized.

Build the AR functionality: Using the chosen AR SDK, build the AR functionality that will allow users to see the real world with overlaid navigational data.

Integrate the navigation functionality: Integrate the navigation functionality with the AR functionality. This will require APIs from your chosen navigation service to be used with the AR SDK.

Test the app: Test the app thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning as expected, both in the virtual and physical environments.

Deploy the app: Deploy the app to the Google Play Store and make it available for download.

Keep in mind that developing an AR navigation app for Android can be a complex process, so it may be helpful to seek the assistance of experienced developers or consult online resources for guidance.
